# Sudslingers Website Upgrade

Sudslingers is a self-service dog wash & professional groomer in Wilmington, NC. Their current website is a bit out of date, so I built an upgraded version to pitch to them.

The upgraded site is built with SvelteKit, sources photos from Cloudinary for quick load times, and includes a contact form that validates on the server and is rigged up to send submissions to an email address and/or database once the site goes into production.

> I pulled photos from their current site as much as I could, but I couldn't get my hands on everything I needed, hence why the header logo is low-def and there are a few stock images here and there.

Their current site: [https://www.sudsdogwash.com/](https://www.sudsdogwash.com/)<br>
The proposed upgrade: [https://suds-dog-wash.vercel.app/](https://suds-dog-wash.vercel.app/)
